# Assignment-1
In this Assignment you will be going through the following : 
  - Learning about Jupyter Notebooks and basic libraries to be used througout the course.
  - Loading, displaying and saving images. Understanding basic properties of the images.

# Instructions
- Follow the directory structure as shown below: 
  ```
  ├── src           
        ├──  main.ipynb
  ├── images    
  └── README.md
  ```
- `src` will contain the Jupyter notebooks used for the assignment.
- `images` will contain images used for the questions.
- Follow this directory structure for all following assignments in this course.
- Try to make functions for all the codes since tasks will repeat.

# Questions

1. Put 4 images of your choice into the 'images' folder.
2. Load the images using [OpenCV](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/).
3. Display the images using matplotlib using a 2x2 grid using subplots. Fix the issue if the image seems unusual.
4. convert all the images to grayscale without using any inbuilt functions and save the images into the 'images' folder.
5. Do the same using [Scikit-image](https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/) and [PIL](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
6. Capture an image of yourself using webcam, save it in the 'images' folder.
